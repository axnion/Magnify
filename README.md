To set up dev server:

* Download [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com)
* Download [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Run `vagrant up`
* Run `vagrant ssh` to get into the dev machine
* `cd frontend` to get into the frontend folder, `npm run start` to start frontend server
* `cd backend` to get into the backend folder, `npm run dev` to start backend server

It's that simple!
